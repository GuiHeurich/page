Looks like a website
You navigate between folders, which take you to regions, cultures, or institutions
You can play the sound recordings
You can know more about the specific groups
You can donate, join, apply to work on charities and NGOs that work with these groups
You can see ongoing projects that involve language, music, and cultural documentation

Works on a subscription model
Universities can bulk-buy
Pays royalties, somehow, to the groups involved
